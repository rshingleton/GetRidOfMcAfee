# GetRidOfMcAfee
Simple shell script found in the internet to remove McAfee from your Mac

Here is a modified script who's only purpose is to rip off McAfee versions 2.3.0 through 10.2.1.  Now this works great for us but we do not use anything other than Threat Protection in version 10.2.1.  If you use more modules in 10.2.1 this will most likely miss various services and kernel extensions. 

Simple bash script.  If you feel up to you can add files or folders to the arrays if you want to expand upon it.

Must be run as root
